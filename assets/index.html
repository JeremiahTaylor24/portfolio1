            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>I started my coding journey a few months ago after talking with a friend. He was about 2 years into his journey and told me about the rewarding career path he was on. Right away I was interested. My hope is that in 5 - 10 years I can help others progress and follow their dreams of becoming software developers. Someday I plan to have my own freelancing business and help those who cannot afford web development.</p>
